<b> <u> Lieutenant Mike </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Greater Agent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
Mike used to be part of the Infiltrations Department for The Agency, before being
moved to serve Alice in her own division. The two made a fond bond and they became
good friends. Mike has personally swore to keep Alice safe under all circumstances,
even to the point of sacrifice or betrayal.
<br> <br>
Ofcourse during the raid that The Insurgency had staged on their outpost Mike found
himself with heavy and near fatal injuries that affected his ability to serve. despite 
The Agency trying to give him a medical discharge, he insisted that he would continue
to serve under Commander Alice. after a long debate, he succeeded and recovered overtime
all while watching over her.
<br> <br>
He was willing to help in her ambitions for Project Liberation and had helped in the
preparations in doing so, where Alice was the brains, he would be the Brawns, in terms
of planning anyways. Although he had not fully healed to his best and couldn't dodge
he used to, he could still pack a punch and that's all that mattered to him to keep
Alice safe. 
<br> <br>
However it may take a while for him to get used to looking after a whole squad like
Alice does.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Mike Is an aggressive person, Trying to attack where he sees fit. while he's lacking in
overall firepower, he does carry flashbangs on him, read up on flashbangs in the weapons
category to find out about them.
<br> <br>
* Mike came prepared for the worst, and expected some of you to get downed. The only
Solution? bringing some adrenaline syringes! He has brought 2 just in case, as well as
Alice, don't let them go to waste.
<br> <br>
* Mike is a horrible dodger ever since the incident, and has to rely on tanking or making
heavy dives which leave him vulnerable, keep an eye out to see what he's doing just as much
as you would with Alice in case you need to support him, he may return the favour at a later
date.

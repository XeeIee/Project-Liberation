<b>DATA: Dee's Behaviour Assessment</b>
Flankers are dangerous ambush enemies that leave the opening for other Insurgents to open fire on vulnerable Targets.
They will start by jumping down from a rop and swinging down to kick a player into the ground. Most Enemies will then
take this as a sign to shoot or take down the Dizzied individual.
<br> <br>
After this, the Flanker appears to behave normally to any other soldier, only with improved Armour. They appear resistant
to being Dizzied by Flashbangs and, while our team might be more skilled than them, I feel like the flanker has more dodging
capabilities. Outside of this, remains to be seen if we will get any further distinctions between this Elite and other soldiers.

<b>Strategy: Dee's Behaviour Assessment</b> <br>
* I noticed that during the appearance of the first flanker that the Enemy indicator message had ": /" at the bottom. While the words were invisible it looked
like it could've been an indicator to the Flanker's presence in a battle.
<br> <br>
* The best time to attack a Flanker might be when they're descending from a rope to attack. If only we had a <i>marksman</i> to deal with them.. That would be the
easiest method to attack them during the enemies turn.

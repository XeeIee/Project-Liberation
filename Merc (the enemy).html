<i> Lesser MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Mercs are actual engineers of MERC, looking like more leveled down versions of Golden Scout,
(it was like this previously but it doesn't help to boost his big ass ego), and still sporting most of the skill 
that comes from looking like him. even with their role they're tactical and experienced, but so are you, so going 
through them for the most part should be a cake walk.
<br> <br>
As well as being engineers, they are also the ones that will do meetings on behalf of the higher ups, and other
tasks like reporting information, for example. They're a stepping stone for getting into trusting territory with
MERC, as they dont just offer their services to anyone, you have to drive a hard bargain. Back then MERC were more
lenient with who they were giving their supplies to, now, however, they're strictly giving their tech to The 
Insurgency now, we can blame Golden Scout for this.
<br> <br>
Mercs, as simple as they are, are not good people, never have been, and being paired up with a group with even more
bad people is not a good combo for other factions outside of MERC or The Insurgency.
<br> <br>
Most Mercs used to often be seen carrying out the tasks along side Engineers of The Insurgency, however you won't see
This anymore now that Golden Scout is the new boss.
<br> <br>
Mercs, like scouts, still happily serve under the rule of both MERC and The Insurgency respectfully, and despite looking
like G.Scout rip offs, they will have a wide plethora of clothing that represents what kind of job they are working on,
considering that their engineering skills surpass those of the scouts. 
<br> <br>
Their importance on the battlefield is less, however, since for whatever weird reason the heirarchy is scuffed in MERC
and the Mercs themselves are only used as engineers or the ones to pilot tech, they can normally be seen with melees 
and occasional side arms.

<br>
<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Due to most Mercs using melees, it is very easy to pick them off from a distance, melee is still an option, just know
that you'l be wasting your time.
<br> <br>
* Mercs, despite their low health, are stronger than Rangers and Scouts, this is due to their thicker clothing, and the
fact that they're wearing anything at all that aren't just shirts and trousers.
<br> <br>
* Mercs are very easy to parry, as they love to do one thing, Charge heavy attacks, these normally take a turn to charge
up for fodder enemies, and as such, they're the perfect enemy to practice parry's on, parry's will stun an enemy and maybe
even dizzy them.

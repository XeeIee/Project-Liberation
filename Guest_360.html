<i> Supreme Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Guest is the Head of Security for The Insurgency. While there isn't much to actively say
about his role in The Insurgency, he is still good at his job, paid well for a good few
thousand pounds a month, what a lucky guy. On a side note, yes, sometimes members, really
commonly guards but it could be anyone, are actually hired into the job and are paid good
amounts of money. For example Kylon and Employer-03, who goes by the name █████████, 
experienced this influx first hand.
<br> <br> 
On the topic of 03, she often works with and visits Guest within the Commercial District,
they have shown to a bit of a history together and are good friends. other members aren't 
actually aware of this friendship, though to be fair, nobody actually cares about what the
Employers do around the city, they know better than to question their actions.
<br> <br>
Guest was also a result of The Potential Life anomaly, also as one of the super soldiers
made by Insinitie, this is also where he obtained his Iconic 2 Millimetre Defeater. Dowever, 
he was dealt a different fate, becoming infected by The Dark Lords and momentarily turning 
into a servant for them. He, too, ultimately succumbed to injuries and died by the hands of 
The Saving Grace. Despite this, it was a younger XeeIee and Guest_362 who convinced Light and
GS to use the revive syringe, as from there he was talked into working for The Insurgency by
all of them.
<br> <br>
Ultimately accepting because he didn't have anything better to do, he was able to take his
aspirations of being a police officer into his work, becoming Head of Security and making
significant changes to ensure the increased safety for the Guards who worked under them.
He was way more humane with the side he commanded, Where XeeIee saw his STFU Units as
inconveniences and Dark saw his Soldats as meat shields, Guest recognised that guards had more
humanity to them and thus makes it his priority to keep as many of them alive as his abilities
allow him to.
<br> <br>
Being Head of Security comes with obvious perks, such as a higher say, access to lockdown, and open
sectors of the City, and wide access to the intercoms, however he can still be cut off by higher
clearances.
<br> <br>
Remember, he's not a villain, just a guy with aspirations and a job, who got involved in the wrong
business.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Guest's main gimmick is that he adapts to things easily, it's highly recommended
that you never try anything twice. However, this can also work in your favour to divert
expectations. If you're able to catch him off guard, then the damage he will take will
be massive.
<br> <br>
* Guest's infamous 2 Millimetre Defeater is a dangerous weapon, it can channel the energy
from your attacks and convert it into energy that his hat can utilise to turn into electricity,
Be cautious, as his lightning attacks are very multi hit. The bestway to avoid this turn of events
is to simply not attack him while he is guarding. every attack adds one to a bar which he uses to
determine what attacks he can do with the amount of given energy. The energy not only gives Guest
more attacks, but it can also enhance his already existing ones.
<br> <br>
* Always take Guest's fight seriously. He really hates otherwise. If you don't, he will
become enraged. When guest is enraged, he will overclock himself as Calidus would do to machines, 
giving him two moves per turn until he exits his 'raiged' state, he will also fully charge his 
Defeater when enraged so be very wary of that too.

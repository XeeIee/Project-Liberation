<b>DATA:</b>
Elite Rangers are Rangers that have climbed up the ranks and have 
become Elite Rangers, Rangers that serve directly under Golden Scout.
They use way more experimental and dangerous weaponry like U. and R.
Railguns, and are way more trained in the art of standing on elevated
surfaces and shooting at opposition from above.
<br> <br> 
Contrary to what was initially planned, there is only one Elite
Ranger in the ranks of MERC. As stated in the ranger document, Rangers
rarely live long enough to become Elites as they're constantly bombarded
by Bandit attacks. Elite Rangers were supposed to be apart of a MERC
task force that specialised in holding points of interest. However the
idea was never put into motion as, obviously, the lack of rangers that
ever got the status. Elite Rangers were also considered for The 
Insurgency's Elite Force. But, again, the idea had to be scrapped due to 
lack of members. 
<br> <br>
The reason why the Elite Rangers are selected the way that they are is
because of Golden Scout's idea of Toughness. In order to prove your
worth, you need to not die first. It isn't a matter of skill for him,
it's a matter of experience. Those with the most experience will do
the most things and understand their ideas more. What's the point in
having underlings if they don't share your ideas?
<br> <br>
There isn't half as much as there is to say about Elite Rangers. they're just
better versions of typical Rangers. Nevertheless, still dangerous and a foe
to keep an eye on.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* There is very little threat when an Elite Ranger is by themself. and
as there is only one of them, it would be expected that they aren't high
threats. However they get annoying when there's other threats to deal with,
forcing you to focus on their line of sight as well as other enemies.
<br> It doesn't matter who you're up against. Always, Respect, their sight line.
<br> <br>
* Rangers alike typically can only be dispatched with range, as they're exceptionally
hard to reach with melee. However, if you're out of options, a throable like a grenade
can typically work to knock one off or disrupt their focus on a player.
<br> <br>
* Rangers work on a token system, for every token they (theoretically) have, is another
turn before they fire. they collect tokens by training their sight line on a player, and
lose all tokens when not. This is important to understand as if one player breaks line 
of sight with an Elite Ranger, then they will not lose tokens as fast, only every turn. 
This means that they will just go and focus on a different player with no change in their 
time before firing. The best way to lower time before they fire is to stun or suppress 
them, every turn not firing is a turn they have to spend aiming again.
<br> <br>
* Dodging is very hard to do with elite rangers, like 3 seconds roughly before the shot rings out.
They deal pierce and hard damage, so it's recommended to find cover over dodging outright.
It's a good balance of hiding and stunning, you'll figure it out.

<font size="6"> <br> You've gathered the documents that'll help you locate, track, and hunt Guest_360 
in order to get access to The Mining Sector, a place foretold to be extremely dangerous. However, it
 seems that your team has slipped up and allowed a Soldat to slip out of your reach, and has alerted 
 the entire Insurgency of your whereabouts and what you're currently doing. Worry not, for Mike says
 he can use the map to figure out a few ways in, as the map seems to have a intricate hallway system
 you can exploit. You wouldn't expect them to exploit it back.. </font> <br> <br>

<font size="10"> <u> <b> Chapter 4 </b> </u> </font>
<font size="6"> <br> After dispatching Dark, killing a now pissed XeeIee, and convincing Guest to help
your team, it comes full circle as you begin to approach the MERC HQ using a secret underground system.
Guest says that from now on The Mining Sector is open, ready for you to eneter at any time, which is
the first part of your overground troubles dealt with, now it's time to stick it to Golden Scout. <br>
However.. there's just one issue, it seems that Alices distractions weren't permanent, as MERC have
been preparing for your attempts. What's worse, you still don't know where Alice is, all you know is
that she was fighting Gladiator. Maybe use the time to find her as well? </font> <br> <br>

<CENTER> Tip of the chapter: </CENTER>
<br>
MERC are going to be pretty weak in this point of the story, however don't let that fool you, MERC have
just as many special agents on the scene as The Insurgency, it's a wonder who you haven't heard of yet?

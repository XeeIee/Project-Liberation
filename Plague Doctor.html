The Plague Doctor is an interesting case. Originating from
Tower Defense X, he is one of the first bosses you could
encounter in that game. We like to use him often because of
how easy he is to defeat. sure he may have massive health
pools but his gimmicks do not work in this sort of game. Which
is why he's here!

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Plague Doctor's Primary focus is debuffing. he achieves this
with his spray gun. It's important to know what colour will do what
to your team if hit by it. Be mindful that Gas Masks will nullify
these effects.
<br> Blue Spray - Affects Dodge chance and other speed related stats
<br> Green Spray - Affects Attack potency and other attack chance stats
<br> Red Spray - Affects general damage
<br> If you know which one's which, then you can easily take him out with
co-ordination. Better yet, now you know which ones to use if you end up
taking his stuff!

* Unlock more by beating him more times

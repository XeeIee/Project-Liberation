<i> Lesser Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Soldiers are the actual trained units of The Insurgency, they boast more
knowledge than guards under the concepts of the field of battle, and have
more weaponry. They are typically depicted as wearing black uniforms unlike 
guards, as well as wearing goggles and vests.
<br> <br> 
These are still typical fodder enemies, however they are still major threats.
<br> <br>
Soldiers are typically seen in buildings making rounds and doing business. Most of the
time they can be seen in facilities where they have been stationed in, however some
squads can go from point A to point B in groups of 3 or so.
<br> <br>
Soldiers, in terms of weaponry, are on par with the STFU's, technically. However, where
the STFU's have an unlimited range of weapons, a Typical Soldier will have access to
rifles, pistols, shotguns, and anything that isn't majorly heavy. it's complicated to
pinpoint what they do and don't have, as they have a strict list of what they are and
aren't allowed as standard, yet their range is also very vast, most likely to account for
the kinds of missions that one might be going on.
<br> <br>
Soldiers are purely professional, however you pump them up too much and they begin to
act as bad as the other twisted personnel within The Insurgency's ranks, take the elites
or the STFU's, or even the special agents, Like XeeIee and Dark, amongst others. Soldiers
are still at the bottom of the chain of authority by Insurgency Standards, it doesn't mean
that they're obsolete to the insurgency, as ever soldier counts, and every soldier
intends to make your life a living hell.
<br> <br>
Don't be deterred however, you could be going against Abominations worse than this.

<br>
<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Soldiers are not tanky in the slightest, however as you progress through the campaign
their firepower and health will slowly increase, along with other fodder enemies, so
make sure you're keeping your firepower on the rise to go toe to toe with them. 
<br> <br>
* Soldiers do have radios, however they don't use them. That is unless there is a Commander
on the field which tells them what to do and when. Commanders are dangerous as they
may start telling units to attack when it isn't their turn. The Officer can technically
do this, but it was a more recent change at the time of reading this.
<br> <br>

<br>
<b>Trivia:</b> <br>
* this is the Legacy Design for the Soldier, Due to it just being a reuse of one of my Roblox
Avatars, I decided to actually give it a creative touch, this is the old version.

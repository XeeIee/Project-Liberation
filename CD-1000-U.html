<i> Lesser Dummy</i>

<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
When A Combat Dummy isn't given a setting, they default to a JOAT setting, which stands for
Jack of all Trades for those that live under a rock. In this setting a Combat Dummy will
<i>attempt</i> to perform any and all tasks given to them, depending on the task they could
have great success or minimal success.
<br> <br>
For some odd reason this mode had a few copy and pasted lines of code from one of the 
Supreme Dummies, and boast incredible knowledge on boxing, kick boxing, martial arts, karate,
many more forms on unarmed comabt. while their entire understanding on how to use the 
information given to them is minimal, it still means that they were one of the more dangerous 
Dummies to go against if the stakes are even.
<br> <br>
After some software engineers got to work, they were able to separate the code from the JoaT 
default setting which led to the creation of the Unarmed Combat Setting, where they are now 
used as sparring partners.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Unarmed CD has a huge weakness to ranged weapons, however, they are still prone to 
dodging, keep a steady aim to catch them where it hurts the most.
<br> <br>
* The Unarmed was only designed for duels against only one person, so ganging up on it can make 
quick work of them.

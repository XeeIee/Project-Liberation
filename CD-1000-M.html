<b> <u> CD-1000-M(Medic) </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Lesser Dummy</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
The Medic is a unique case, as they have 2 setting types, Battle Medic, and Surgeon Medic.
However, if need be, Medics can be specialised into a certain field with CD's that
contain information on how to perform a certain job. These CD's can be applied to almost 
every setting, so long as it is meant for that setting type.
<br> <br>
Battle Medics are the Medics that you fight during the Prelude, They have medkits and tend
to the other Combat Dummies. This does not mean that they can't treat humans, otherwise they
would have near to no effective use in human society, and would be deeped worthless.
<br> <br>
This has posed questions that have been asked by those who had more than 2 braincells to think 
with. "If the Combat Dummy series can also be treated with medkits, how similar is their 
anatomy to that of humans and what quirks to they possess in order to be able to take the same 
treatment?" The Agency at this time has not revealed the secret to the public, however it 
is safe to say that their methods of unique robotics are far more humane than that of The 
Insurgency.
<br> <br>
Surgeon Medics, however, are more primal than their Battle counterpart. They lose most of their 
built in data in exchange for info on how to perform surgeries. They are extremely reliable, but 
aren't perfect, like a human. They do, however, to make up for this, as they contain the TTS 
addon, which allows them to have genuine conversations with people, unlike the other Combat 
Dummies that only respond to commands.
<br> <br>
Despite the simplicity of the Medic setting on the combat dummy, it still knows basic defense, not
effectively but enough to hold it's own for a while, a stupid design choice in hindsight.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Medic, like The Shield, has a priority system of which they use to heal more important allies
 in the heat of battle, However, unlike The Shielders, you should try to dispatch the medic if they
begin to heal a very important enemy, or atleast stop them from healing. you fortunately have a
turn to do this.
<br> <br>
* A Medic can never prioritise the same enemy as a Shielder. And due to this logic, a logic error 
is formed within the code of these 2, A medic cannot be shielded by a Sheilder and vice versa.
<br> <br>
* Medics should absolutely be dispatched with melee, because there is a chance that their medkit
will still be intact, and you can loot it for your team. This applies to other enemies, but due
to the fragility of the Medkit, it will normally break upon being fired at. Which can be used
to your advantage if you want to stop a Medic from healing.

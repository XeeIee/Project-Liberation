<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
During the time of the popularity of the CD series, many uses and situations were thought
of and created using the easy to change code of the Combat dummies software, many places
suffered from constant riots, like London, due to the discovery of an omnipotent entity
that had apparently made itself known to the public and began to spread 'rumours' as a
means to cause chaos.
<br> <br>
It is unknown whether these reports were refering to the leader of The Insurgency at the
moment of writing this, or something else entirely. However considering the surge of paranormal
entities and phenomena that have come out as of late 2010, it is hard to pinpoint who or what is
responsible for these rumours. 
<br> <br>
In response The Agency created the Rioter setting, better referred to as the shielders, which
would protect government officials from angry mobs of civilians from harm, and served as the
perfect body guard. High importance companies like government funded businesses, military officials,
and people were even appointing them for things like security work, which hey it isn't it's job, but
free money on The Agency's end.
<br> <br>
However, this surge of CD's resulted in unemployment rates due to many people who had jobs linked with 
security and protection to become obsolete, this was one of the many reasons why the Combat Dummy model
was retired, and all models were recalled into The Agency HQ.
<br> <br>
Currently they are used to restrict access to classified documents, as well as help train soldiers like you
see them do during the events of the prelude.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Shielder is a Purely defensive enemy, they Have a priority system of which they use to shield
more important allies in the heat of battle, use this to your advantage to pick off fodder enemies.
<br> <br>
* The Shielder that the Shielders use are highly indestructible, made out of materials similar to titanium.
however, they only have 1, getting a shielder from 2 angles confuses them, and due to the outdated nature
of the software, will drop the shield.
<br> <br>
* Try and keep a distance from a Shielder, their swings are fatal, and often cause the dizzy effect, the best way to 
approach one is to catch them from behind, and force them to disarm, or, if you are a more agile class, you can surf the
shield and get behind them, being able to attack them in the same turn.

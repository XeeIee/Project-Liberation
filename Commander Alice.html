<b> <u> Commander Alice </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Supreme Agent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>

<br> <br> 
The agency is a professional organisation that was built to supress tranical military factions that had 
went against the newly founded WPTP <i>(World Peace Treaty Pact)</i>. They Had made terms with 
groups before and had planned to make The Insurgency part of this Faction while they were still in their
infancy. However, conflicts arose and the 2 had found themselves in a cold war.
<br> <br>
Alice is a very well respected commander of <i>The Agency</i> due to her skills and
overall likeability. Thus, the higher ups had decided to give her her own squad to
command and was tasked with defending an outpost not too far from <i>The Insurgency.</i>
<br> <br>
Back then she never knew the true brutality of The insurgency or the sheer strength
of their forces. However, This changed when The Insurgency launched a full scale
attack on the base she was stationed at with her squad.
<br> <br>
From here it was then that she saw the overwhelming cruelty and unending threat that it posed
not just to her, not just The Agency, but to the world as a whole. She became obsessed with
taking them down and went to extreme lengths to get the job done, entrusting the only
surviving member of her squad after the raid, Mike, in assisting her as the only
lieutenant in the operation. But she knew that regular soldiers wouldn't cut it, no. She 
needed soldiers trained specifically for the task, who were just as determined as she was in 
taking them down. 
<br> <br>
That's where <i>you</i> come in, don't let her down.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Alice would never turn against you, however she does not like things being done the violent
way, she has good morality and mainly knows right from wrong, while gaining a bad relation
with her does affect her judgement of you, you'd have to do something really bad for her to
go against you.
<br> <br>
* Alice has a bit of a tendency to try and defend her team, and will often try to <i>parry</i>
or tank hits for you, while this sounds good on paper, you might accidentally hurt her in the
progress of your attack if you co-ordinate wrong, always get someone to check if she's making
a move or not. 
<br> <br>
* Alice has a really keen eye, and will often try and point things out, like weak points in
enemies, or suspicious parts of scenery. it would be advised to try and get her to observe
surroundings as often as possible, not only will it help give you a sense of area, but could
also really help you against a tough enemy.

<i> Lesser Dummy</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
The Gunner was designed with exploration in mind, they would be told a route that they would
follow, and using advanced pathfinding would treck through all of the points displayed,
eliminating enemies as they progress. under the context of battle they work best in numbers.
<br> <br>
Typically handed pistol esc weapons, these Dummies would often rely on range, the code that 
they were comprised of was very outdated, and it still is, as they are one of the earliest 
settings.
<br> <br>
They don't have the capabilities to make unique decisions based on the situation around them
and rely on an advanced yes or no statement system to carry out tasks. due to the recall of
these units for The Agency HQ the code was never improved.
<br> <br>
Due to the light weight armour that the Combat Dummy poses, it is difficult for them to
accurately hold heavier weapons like high caliber rifles and heavy machine guns for example.
Hence why most models are seen using Pistols or Shotguns at best. However with an upgrade to 
a heavier exo skeleton it is possible to allow the CD to boast high hardness and toughness on 
the inside, as well as showing off a sleek outter exterior; Materials are only so sparce, 
however, and thus there are little of these Combat Dummies roaming around.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Gunner likes to supress the enemies instead of actually hitting them, this forces an ally
into supression, a mechanic which can be read about in the Discord Server. This does mean that
there is little chance of getting hit by one of the bullets, which you can use to your advantage.
<br> <br>
* A fatal flaw of The Gunner is that they are not programmed for close quarters, so they keep a 
disance at all times, you can easily overwhelms a Gunner by pushing the offensive instead of 
allowing one to keep the team supressed.

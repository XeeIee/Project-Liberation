<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The Assistant, or sometimes called Amy for short, is exactly as her name suggests,
she's an Assistant. While not directly for any one Interloper, she is primarily seen
assisting The Interloper with his projects. Like accounting for outcomes, checking variables,
editting the console, and a bit more. She is one of the many recovered of the Shattered Species,
a lost race from the old world that inhabited the Old Nexus Point. The Nexus Point, or also 
known back then as The Void (Creative I know, I'm only going off of data, leave me alone >:[. 
Someone really needs to put a dent into whoever came up with these names man I swear), was a 
black hole with anomalous properties that allowed people to stand on a non existing surface.
However the topic on The Past and Present Nexus Point is another file in it of itself, and also
has no ties to Project Liberation itself. You'd only be wasting your money.
<br> <br> 
Back onto topic, What is the difference between Interlopers, and The Interloper? Well, The Interloper
is, as you should know, a concept manifest, He can never truly go away because as long as one person
is aware of his existence, his mental, physical, or whatever image he manifests himself as, cannot fade.
So by logic in order to kill The Interloper, the only way to kill The Interloper, would be to destroy
everything. (TL:DR, Impossible.)
<br> <br>
Interlopers on the other hand? They are typically a select few individuals with various ties to Non-belonging.
They have managed to force themselves out of areas they shouldn't, encountered The Interloper, was force fed
a bunch of knowledge, and if they didn't go insane, then deals and applications were made. Not a lengthy
process, or a clean process, but one that works. Interlopers are scarce, but enough to cover the whole of, well,
mental creativity. They keep things going, on track, in a cronological order, and if it diverts from the path,
they use their powers to fix it back on track by any means. Of course, typical definition as listed changes can
divert occasionally, but the idea is there for an absolute basic explanation for you.
<br> <br>
Back onto Amy, She is one of the select few who have no limitations to The Console, she can do whatever and however,
The Interloper has a lot of faith in her, mainly due to her efficiency, but she has the tendency to push her limits
set and play rebellious, like going against rules or doing things because it's fun or funny. 
<br> <br>
A little extra thing about Assistant is that she has terrible motor skills, and can't control her own body movements as
easily as most. This is just one of the many side affects of The Shattered, and while still uncommon within them, is something
that shouldn't be seen as odd. Just something I felt like adding that she specifically told me not to add.
<br> <br>
Amy was primarily included as a support to keep all the more intricate things of Project Liberation stable, however
she now acts as a counter measure for if Project Liberation goes south and the route diverts way too far from it's
initial course. We're talking outside the city, trying to fight people all the way in America level too far. While the
main factor for this is being outside the city from here on out, there are still things that can be done inside the
city that could garner the attention of the Interlopers. For one, the team splitting up. Multiple paths requires
more attention on both parties and slower timeline movement, think of a computer having to multitask several instructions,
it moves slow, but it's still moving. In this case it would be the Job of an Interloper to try and keep the team as close
as possible, whether that be as friend or foe, just to save time.
<br> <br>
And similar things can, have, and will be sorted out where needed. And you'd be none the wiser.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* I have no advice for you that isn't just advice from The Interloper. She has the same powers, just can technically
be actually harmed. Don't think you can kill her, your better off just heavily telegraphing your attacks, because
ultimately she can't even be touched.
<br> <br>
* Similar to a certain someone, She has grown to not take anything seriously. Maybe you can use that info somehow
I don't know, you're better off just not fighting her.
<br> <br>
* Oh, and, don't call her Amy. Only people she considers a sort of close friend can do that. You might not suffer 
immediate pentalties, but she doesn't like it.

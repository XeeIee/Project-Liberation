<i> Supreme MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Light is the left hand man for GS, and also a Contract Mercenary for MERC.
Light is known by his peers to be excessively prideful, but also really good
at his job, said job being to hunt down and assassinate persons of interest
on behalf of The Insurgency. This initially was a three man effort, consisting
of Light, Guest_362, and Golden Scout, where they could collectively synergise
their strengths to overwhelm the target. Light as the Offense, Golden Scout as
the Defense, and 362 as the support. 
<br> <br> 
To accomplish this, all three of them have experimental gear. Light has the most
of this gear, along with a couple augments. His spear can be called back to him as
part of an implanted chip in his brain. His armour contains experimental technology
scrapped off of what little CD's The Insurgency were able to scam from the insurgency
before they were all called back. While Dee is the only CD who has some form of
regenerative capabilities, the other CD's still contain similar components that they
thought they could analyse and study to produce similar results in the form of
armour.
<br> <br>
Light also has an augment in his back, a pair of wings detached from the focal
points that allows him to fly in quick bursts towards enemies with little
to no effort. while his wings don't allow for large distance travel at fast speeds,
it still allows to stay airborne or to strafe attacks. His Spear is also highly
conductive, assumed to have been made from a material harvested from one of the
swords used by the mythical Saving Grace. Nobody has or can confirm this, and
Light is too arrogant to give up the information freely. Electricity is a very 
dangerous weapon in the Insurgency City, many Elites and Employers utilise
Calidus' Electrical technology both as a way to power the City, but as a way
to wipe entire armies by chaining electric between them. Light loves to abuse
elecrticity to the highest capacity, considering his spear can absorb huge
abundances of it, however not all of his gear is resistant to it.
<br> <br>
This trio of mercenaries all use codenames, Golden Scouts is GS, Guest_362's is 362,and
Lights is actually still Light. Light is his code name, not his real name, his
real name is actually ██████. Light is considered to be related to Dark, and while
they do have a moderately good friendship, they do not seem to be blood related.
<br> <br>
Light, while not one of the more known elites of The Insurgency, is still a
formidable force. Compared to the Insurgency, he's not a big fish. But in
MERC? He's one of the worst things you could be facing.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* You can easily distrupt or completely stop Lights wings from functioning by 
hitting him with an electrical current, it will also stop him from attacking 
(if it is his turn), or skip his next turn (if it's your turn). Be careful 
though, as those same  electrical currents charge his spear to deal shock 
damage.
<br> <br>
* Light is ruthless in his attacks, and will give you little to no room to
breathe. He's also very impatient, and will try to attack as many people as
he can when it's not his turn. He will try to catch people off guard with
the AGAIN mechanic. After dodging one of his attacks via typical dodging
methods, you might recieve a bolded text afterwards that says Again, with
NO PING (he can do this more than once). While easy to avoid, this can 
still catch people off guard who don't pay attention.
<br> <br>
* Lights pride clouds some of his judgement, while it's actually quite
difficult to get under his skin and enrage him, you can still bait him
to act brashly. Try taunting him from time to time, just make sure to
be aware for any potential ranged attacks he may try.

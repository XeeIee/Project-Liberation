<i> Employer 03 - Strategist</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Velvie is the third employer out of the 7. Specialising in Strategy, and being the one to organise major movements
within The Insurgency's higher ranks and the general army, she has proven herself to be a vital asset in their
plans, even if she's the newest member. Like Guest_360, she was convinced to work for The Insurgency. Unlike Guest,
She has no correlation with the Potential Life Anomaly, As she was neither one allied with the Dark Lords or The
Saving Grace. She initially started off by trying to find Guest, considering his lengthy absense after what had happened.
The Insurgency found her first, as a chain of events lead to her stumbling into a high security Insurgency Base. The
Employers, impressed by her stealthiness, decided to keep her alive on the off chance that she proved useful.
<br> <br> 
After Guest had heard of Velvie's capture, he immediately began to try and bargain for her survival (at the minimum),
During his earlier days he knew what had happened to the mental psyche of his other 'friends', Dark and Xeelee. And he
knew that if Velvie ended up allying with The Insurgency, she too would be rotted and corrupted into a psychopathic
monster, devoid of morals. While he was able to convince The Employers to not kill her, he had unfortunately backed his
arguments against a wall, and Guest had no choice but to accept the reality that Velvie was going to become one of them.
<br> <br>
She started off in the same sector as Guest, mainly because he asked, so that he could keep an eye on her, and also make sure
Neither Dark or Xeelee would see her, god forbid how that would play out. She was good enough at her job, working as a guard,
However she was unknowingly rising the ranks faster than the other Guards, to the point that they were running out of
positions to issue her, and it came to the point where her rank supassed Guests, meaning he couldn't watch over her anymore.
<br> <br>
Eventually, after the casualty of the previous 03, thanks to the scuffle between an incredibly pissed XeeIee, and Calidus, The
Other employers turned to look at Velvie, who they thought had potential. So, they brought her in, put her through a few Mental,
Moral, and Physical tests, and decided to train her to be the next Strategist of The Employers.
<br> <br>
Velvie's spirit slowly withered away with the roll, but her attitude didn't. She continued to act somewhat like herself, at least
for a while. Soon, even she began to fall to the psychological tricks of The Employers, turning into a husk of her former self.
Guest, hearing the news, was naturally distraught, he had lost another friend to these sick employers that he worked under. But,
alas, he couldn't do anything about it.
<br> <br>
Not yet, anyways, he eventually forgot about it, as his spirit too withered away. But Guest was a man of logic, and it wouldn't take
long for it to come back to him. Aand maybe then, he can do something about the wicked ways that his friends have turned.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Velvie is in charge for all the operations and strategies that higher ranking Insurgents employ, if you dispatch her, then The Insurgency
as a whole will become more disorganised. However don't expect it to be easy to catch an Employer out of the tower. And without protection
no less.
<br> <br>
* Fighting wise, Velvie takes leadership for battles if there is nobody else to fill that role, ordering people what to do and using general
tactics to aid those around her to victory. You can distract her by baiting her into argumentive conversations. While she isn't the type
to resort to witty drama, not are any of the Employers, she's still the freshest and youngest, so she falls for it anyways. She also can't
handle insults very well.
<br> <br>
* Unlike other familiar faces that you might have faced, Velvie is not a super soldier, by the definition of The Potential Life Anomaly. Thus,
She needs to rely on Insurgency Technology to keep herself in the fight. She uses disorientation equipment to dizzy people who don't have
ear protection, she fakes attacks by baiting you to perform a QTE, she creates illusions of herself using audio waves and illusion disks,
and also employs Psychological tactics to get the upper hand. See through these ruses and your sure to take her down swiftly.

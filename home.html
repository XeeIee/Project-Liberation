<font size="6"> <br>After making it into The Insurgency City, things begin to get more dangerous as 
your actions have already been made aware to Lord Calidus. However, in order to sabotage their 
operations and get into the dangerous and dark Mining sector, you must split into two
temporary groups, group one will be with Alice, and the other will be with Mike. Be careful however,
as the outer rim of the city is where MERC keeps their main operations, and it's also home to some
of the most dangerous soldiers around.</font> <br> <br>

<CENTER> Tip of the chapter: </CENTER>
<br>
There's a difference between Critical attacks and Heavy attacks. Learn the difference!
<br>
A CRIT is a random occurance, it can happen with any attack, at any point in time.
<br>
A HEAVY Attack is when you charge an attack, this can only be done with Melee and Unarmed attacks,
unfortunately not ranged. Heavy attacks are also less about physical damage (in most cases) and more
about dealing effects to an enemy or a teammate, be cautious!

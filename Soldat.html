<i> Lesser Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Soldats are higher ranked soldiers of the isnurgency, 
<br> <br> 
They are way more dangerous than soldiers, as they can communicate between themselves
using radio. This makes them way more co-ordinated, and they can also relay plans 
and tactics to other units, of course assuming that the unit has a radio.
<br> <br>
They are typically seen in groups of three, while they are less common than soldiers
they are still high in numbers, and spend most of their time around the outskirts of
The Insurgency Tower. you might see them out and about aswell just making some rounds,
or even responding to your infiltrations.
<br> <br>
Where there's Soldats, however, there's Commanders, Soldats are always chauffeuring more
important members around, Commanders mainly, and never the VIP's. Due to the high status
of some of the members in The Insurgency having too much importance, Soldats are often just
kept down to the lower ranks despite their somewhat lower superiority. 
<br> <br>
Soldats are insanely cruel, willing to ploy any dirty tricks in order to kill, they love to
play with their food, and it looks like you just stepped onto the plate.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The best way to approach a Soldat in this current stage of the game is to attack them before
they attack you, if you don't give them time to think, it gives you the chance to push the offensive.
this strategy becomes more difficult as you get deeper into the campaign, and as more enemies are revealed.
<br> <br>
* Soldats often have assault weapons on them, if you're running low on ammo and don't have time to stock up,
then take one of their weapons, they won't have spare mags but they'll help you fendoff the hoards.
<br> <br>
* Soldats are one of the more dangerous units as they actually know how to.. DODGE, albeit rare, they will dodge,
or maybe even counter, be cautious.
 <br> <br>

<b>Trivia:</b> <br>
* this is the Legacy Design for the Soldat, Due to it just being a reuse of one of my Roblox
Avatars, I decided to actually give it a creative touch, this was the old design.

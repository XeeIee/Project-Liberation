<b>DATA:</b>
Gladiator used to be the right hand man of MERC, following the boss loyally. He was
very liked in MERC for his smart thinking and charisma, while he never had to work
on engineering projects, he always loved to fight for MERC, in honour and duty, y'know,
typical warrior stuff. Any robloxian from The Heights has always had a sense of honour
in battle, living for the thrill of an even battle, the highest stakes with the swords
clashing against eachother, and this is where The Gladiator thrived, and he chooses to
incorperate his old life into his new one.
<br> <br> 
As for how MERC Treated him personally, pretty good actually, he was given easy recognition
for his contributions and as often let into top secret projects, even through all of MERCs
twisted ideologies however his morals stayed humane and pure, this is where Golden Scout
contrasted from Gladiator. Even with a distant rival breathing on his back, he served the
leader of MERC happily.
<br> <br>
That was until Golden Scout usurped that position where his loyalty began to falter. His
trust that seemed to last for so long seemed to disappear, as he was no longer let into
top secret projects, his recognition was only among those who he told, and over all his
work conditions were dire. Yet he pushed through and saw it as a challenge to a warriors
strength of will.
<br> <br>
This kept up until he ultimately snapped, Learning of The Bullseye Project. He stormed
into Golden Scouts office and argued with him like the world was at stake. Golden Scout
Didn't care, and Gladiator was 'kindly' kicked out of MERC and into the outskirts.
<br> <br>
He saw the threat, and after giving an anonymous tip to The Agency, planned to storm into
the city on his own terms. Who knows if he's working with you, or if he has his own plans.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Don't let Gladiator's health fool you, The determination of a warrior from The Heights is
not to be underestimated, and thus, don't expect him to go down simply. he has corpus just 
like you.
<br> <br>
* Gladiator is purely Melee, however he has ways of closing the gap and avoiding your guns, 
where guns fail don't shy away from trying a melee in a last ditch effort, even if melee is 
what Gladiator excells at.
<br> <br>
* Gladiator may look simple at first, but be warned. He may occasinally go into an enraged state
Aka 'warriors call'. This will work like the before seen Overclock, and give him twice as many turns.
when he does this prioritise your health over damage, as his enraged state does not last for long.

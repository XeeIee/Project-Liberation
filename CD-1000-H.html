<b> <u> CD-1000-H(Heavy Gunner) </b> </u> <br>

<i> Greater Dummy</i>

<br>
<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
The Heavy Gunner was built solely for warfare, and more specifically aimed against trench
warfare of some kind. Using their Customly modified PKM they would mow down all enemies
in their wake, keeping a slow yet accurate trace on a target dare they try to outmaneuver
the barrel of the gun. Their Left arm typically has plating similar to that of the CD-1000-S's
shield, however this one that you fight against is a worn down one, and had it broken off
ages ago.
<br> <br>
The Heavy Gunner is not a setting on the default CD, and instead it's own separate model, 
this is due to the new size being used to story more bulky components that adds to the 
toughness of the model, all the while still keeping the natural revolutionary tech that 
the CD series is notorious for having.
<br> <br>
However, the design came at a fatal flaw, the neck, which was easy to damage of put under
tension, since the structure of the neck is the same as the other CD's, the neck is still
very fragile, they solved this by making the Heavy Gunner immune to flashbangs and other
types of disorienting equipment.
<br> <br>
Even as of now the Heavy Gunner stands as a testiment to the authoritarian role that The
Agency plays in the World Peace Treaty Pact, and just how much of a contrast they boast 
compared to the likes of MERC and The Insurgency.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Heavy gunner classifies as a brute, hance forth, if you attack them enough times,
they will tire themself out which will allow you to perform a <i>Takedown</i>. However
don't expect this to be as easy with other brute classed enemies in the near future.
<br> <br>
* The Heavy gunner will choose one party member to fire at consistently, they will not
stop firing at them until they are either in melee range or the target is out of sight.
Be cautious as the more you avoid the Heavy Gunner's barage of bullets, the more
accurate it get's.
<br> <br>
* The Heavy Gunner still has instincts of when it's left arm wasn't damaged, and will
attempt to swing at you if you get too close, you can do this to either get them to
stop firing and reset their target and accuracy, or to counter attack if they miss
or you parry them.

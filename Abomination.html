<b>DATA:</b>
The Abomination is a freak against nature, a metalic interior shell
mostly empty aside from the skeletal replications that make up it's
foundations, and a fleshy Exterior, pooling out of a long decayed
suit of robotic armour. The Shell of the armour that protected it has
long since decayed, however in it's full structure it was used as the
protective layer for Mark II. Due to the priorities and importance of
The Abominations existence, and paired with the impeccable design of
Mark II's detachable armour, the armour was given to The Abomination.
<br> <br> 
The Abominations properties, however, made the flesh begin to absorb
the armour into the flesh. Which did increase the durability of the
flesh, but also left a hideous mass in place of the neat design of
the armour. This did result in the Flesh being unreasonably tough,
to the point that The Abomination is considered indestructable by many.
In reality, it's just incredibly hard to destroy.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Abomination is very fast, It can run fast enough to keep up 
with trains.  However this is only technically true if it has a lot 
of space. so if you ever need to escape from it, make sure to push 
yourself in hard to reach areas, it will halt its progress a
significant amount and maybe even enough to escape it.

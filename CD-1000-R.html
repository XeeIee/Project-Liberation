<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
The CD-1000-R is a standard infantry that was used for The Agency prior to their transformation
into the same name. They served as 'simple' fodder with a complex mindset. They had above average
intelligence by Combat Dummy standards and were known to carry a wide assortment of guns with them
so that they could never truly be disarmed.
<br> <br>
However, with the new establishment of The Agency, and the recall of all mass distributed Combat
Dummies, The Ranger was repurposed into autonomous Scouts, and also used for many other purposes.
Some of these purposes include, but are not limited to; Being guards for Dee, target practice for
soldiers, afformentioned scouts, and teaching soldiers gun anatomy, since that seemed to be an
odd facination withing the ranks of The Agency, they like guns.
<br> <br>
Back onto the topic of the 'autonomous' scouts, upon trying to code this into the Rangers, a discovery
was made that apparently all of the Combat Dummies were autonomous. This was confusing considering
their not exactly fair treatment, they never rebelled or tried anything funny, they just did as told.
this discovery was infact what would lead into the further development of CD-1001-TI.
<br> <br>
The Ranger stands today as another testiment to the sometimes accidental genius of The Agency, and their
further ability to adapt and improvise. they would often share their accomplishments with other factions
in order to brag, in reality is was a way to show how powerful they were.
<br> <br>
This in hindsight wasn't smart, as they loved to tease the hell out of The Insurgency, and it is probably
what led to the cold war between the two factions.

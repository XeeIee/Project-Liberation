<b> <u> Avia Solace </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Killing Machine</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Avia, while having a pretty good and successful life in her childhood, like school and
popularity, was living a life hidden to the public of competition and high expectations.
Even then, her upbringing was not ideal, and most of the time Avia did not want to compete
for the highest achievements. nonetheless, her natural talent did not help her in the slightest.
<br> <br> 
Even after leaving school, her success would carry her into the police force, where her skills
and likability would excell. Her future was promising as her position in her career only went
higher and higher.
<br> <br>
But ofcourse, the war had started, and she was forcefully drafted and found her way into Stronghold
5-5, a now mythical squad with just as many feats as Avia had claimed, slaughtering drafted and
helpless Nusians, defending heavy weapons like railguns and even blowing up a bunker, which was
ultimately her last mission.
<br> <br>
Her service in the war and already likable reputation made her almost like a celebrity, however
it's unclear if such fame is what she really wanted, or if she was just following the path 
given to her by superiors.
<br> <br>
Ofcourse, serving in a war never comes without drawbacks, unless you're sick in the head and/or
insane, you're bound to get some PTSD, and Avia was not an exception despite her flawlessness in
the eyes of the world. not to mention a certain sickness that came from the mass slaughtering of
Nusians, not sure if it was a zone in, not sure if it was a sick euphoria, I couldn't tell you myself.
<br> <br>
Through it all there was always something missing, an empty hole left by no call to action, no thrill,
no battle. In a turn of events this is where Avia sumbles across the ad for Project Liberation.
She's intrigued, and in her own mind it's another chance to prove her worth in the world as if she hasn't
done it already, and also a way to prove herself to her parents. Whatever happens, she knows it'll be a blast.
<br> <br>
However, Avia has this feeling, like something's wrong. Not with the Project, but with The Insurgency.
The way they were described, it was worse than what the war painted the Nusians as. Experiments?
Mass faction obliteration? Total world domination?? Capturing and exploiting of numerous races???
No, this wasn't just for thrill, or just for proving self worth. No, this?
<br> <br>
In Avias eyes, this was for justice.

<b><u>PROS AND CONS:</b></u><br>
(+) Avia is already an expert in several kinds of combat due to her military 
background<br>
(+) She's really cooperative and works the best when with a team<br>
(+) She has amazing morale, and confort teammates very effectively<br>
(/) Getting a high amount of kills in a short period of time, (aka a killstreak)
temporatily does something to her psyche, remains to be seen.<br>
(-) She has a horrible time coping with failiure, not only having a mass
fear of it they can also bring her down just as easy.<br>
(-) sometimes can go off of the main objective<br>
(-) Uncooperative with unfriendly people, be it enemy or ally.<br>
(-) Racist towards Nusians and Bacians.

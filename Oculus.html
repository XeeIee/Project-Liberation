<b>DATA:</b>
Oculus was a Scout for the UNIT, a group very similar to The Agency
in their goal to keep the world in peaceful order. He was very good
at what he did, and took quite an interest to The Razor Clone Army,
(A group that was dismantled by The Insurgency), this was because
he as told to watch them, however this slowly turned into a facination
and Oculus yearned to know more.
<br> <br> 
During the time of this short war it was here that he donned the name
"Oculus". For reasons that he has refused to share with us at this 
moment in time we do not know why this is. Following the short war, 
and the overtake of The clone army, Oculus was left curious about the
 nature of this mysterious group, and began to dig deeper into their 
origins. 
<br> <br>
Upon looking at one of the oldest known warehouses that kept the 
technology that allowed the original Razor, (Who is currently MIA in 
the moment of writing), to be mass clone, it was he that he uncovered
Phineus, the last clone with no knowledge, coincidentally Oculus was
practically obsessed with the clones and knew all about them, so he 
could easily fact dump him to catch him up, which took a while.
Even then the clone didn't learn much from his crazed ramblings that
were meant to "teach" him, but in fact only confused Phineus even
more.
<br> <br>
UNIT had been disbanded due to a rivalry group taking them down from
the inside out, and Oculus was left to his own devices, mainly obsessing
over the clones, it was unhealthy, but he did it regardless, though
it was hard to do so when the only remaining trace of the clone army
disappears when he turns his back.
<br> <br>
No trace, absolutely no trace, Oculus looked everywhere, he was stumped,
and slowly his obcession recided, and his life went back to normal. That
is until the rumours began to spread that the Phineus was within the
walls of The Insurgency City, and so he took up his arms and enlisted
into Project Liberation.

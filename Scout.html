<i> Lesser MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Scouts are the back bones of MERC, incredibly knowledgable in all sorts of engineering,
as well as holding the skills to build moderate scaled projects by their lone some. In
numbers they can achieve a lot of feats, and it's no surprise when most of MERC are brains
and not brawns.
<br> <br> 
Let me repeat, not brawns. Scouts are not strong or durable in the slightest, and are very
weak fodder on the battle field. however, MERC likes to deploy them anyways, the strategy is
unknown, but if given the chance the scouts can still be very deadly, when given the
right fire power, for example.
<br> <br>
This adds into why The Insurgency and MERC combinded, one reason is that the old leader of MERC 
wanted to save his group from the inevitable <i>Bullseye Project</i>, but also because it could 
help boost the corperation's main focus, tapping into unknown sources and using them for 
technological advances,mainly in warfare, sometimes in twisted experiments held by the MERC 
Scientist.
<br> <br>
Scouts stand at the bottom of the non existent hierarchy within MERC. I say non existent because
MERC accels in co-orperation, this is why they are able to get things done so fast, there are no
arguments, no debates on what to do. their leader gives a command, and the workers do it in break
neck speeds.
<br> <br>
However, with the new disappearence of the MERC Leader, Golden Scout has 'took' that place and
is now the one calling the shots, despite how similar the work feels, his ideas are more tyranical.
This has lead to some dangerous weapons being created under the nose of many. But then again, the lesser
Scouts are just in it for the pay day.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Scouts are insanely weak, and boast no armour, or defense, plus their health pool is very low. it
would be advised to take them down only when it is needed to save the resources for higher priority
targets. And even when you're taking a scout down, just use a melee, they will do much more and you
save bullets.
<br> <br>
* Just because they're weak, doesn't mean you should toy around and go easy on them, Scouts are smart,
and are also really crafty, using guns that contrast, and sometimes counter, your own in terms of situation, 
these weapons are impossible to obtain, and are annoying to deal with, the advantage may be minimal, but a 
single stat change is the difference between life and death, especially in the higher game modes. 
<br> <br>
* Scouts have one weakness that is easy to exploit, they dizzy really easily, if you have a Killing Machine 
on your team the Scouts just turn into medkits that fight back.

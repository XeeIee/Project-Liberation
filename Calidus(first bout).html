<b> <u> Lord Calidus </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> INSURGENCY'S LEADER</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The leader of the Insurgency in all of his shattered glory. Very little is currently known
about him, his origins, his role in this world, and every space inbetween, but it is evidently
clear that he has bad intentions, as he's the one responsible for all the wrong doings in PL.
<br> <br> 
Calidus is a Narcissist with a god complex, he views the world as a playground as any other
evil god wanna be would. Like other previously encountered foes like Insinitie, Cranto, Error,
MainFrame, Light(FW), and many more in the future. However, the thing that currently sets himself
about from the rest, is his adaptability.
<br> <br>
What do I mean? Well, Calidus is a fast learner, and will often ploy tactics garnered from tactics and
skills that your team has. If something looks too easy around him, that's because it is. Not only that,
But his sights have lead him to see the likes of Insinite and Cranto themselves, he's seen it all using
The Console, and he can see more if he knows where to look.
<br> <br>
Speaking of the console, Yes, he has access to it. The Console is a tool given to Otherworldly beings, 
whether they are aware of it's existance or not, that allow them into the systems and code of the worlds 
they reside in and beyond, you have seen Foes like Error and The Game Master use them before, however they 
always hid the console commands from you so that you were none the wiser. (For the Record, The Interloper 
Counteracted this with his Firewall.)
<br> <br>
Back to calidus, The reason why him having access to The Console is bad is because of it's Logs Feature. The
Logs are a series of inputs gathered from #Action Channels, who's speaking, who's doing what, location shifting,
It's all documented within this feature. And Calidus can see what you're doing not just in PL, but how
you've acted in other Campaigns. Expect him to use some of those other ploys against you, some fair, some..
well.. not so much.
<br> <br>
At the end of the day, Calidus is a God, yet even with his access to the Console and it's interesting ties
to the real world, he is not an aware one.

<br>
<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Calidus has a strict moveset, he may act like he can do anything but even he is binded by the limitations of
his own abilities. It doesn't mean he has little attacks, it means that he can't pull whatever the hell he wants
in order to win.
<br> <br>
* Considering your team is a bunch of soldiers, Calidus highly underestimates you, and thus his defences are always
down until other wise, He has a natural shield of armour around his skin that acts like a dampener, he only begins
to feel damage when it's broken. Unfortunately, it regenerates, but the period is too long for it to be in the
middle of the fight.
<br> <br>
* Calidus' Sentinels are a summon that he creates in order to divert attention to himself. Once created.. Well
not even I know what they do, just assume that they tank hits or try to fly into you or something idfk :>

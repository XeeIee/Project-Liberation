<i> Heavy Weapons</i>

<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Kylon initially started out as a standard citizen. Simple job, simple life.
It's the kind of life that anyone would get bored of, simple routine with no
freedom to do whatever you wanted, slaving away at a typical 9 to 5 just to
make ends meet. Of course, these are the kinds of people who The Insurgency
look to exploit, and in a stroke of unfortunate circumstances Kylon found himself
pulled into their grasp. One day, while working away in the gym that he had
picked to try and secure some cash, he stumbled upon one of The Insurgency's
add posters. Overpromising an impossible to maintain amount of money. 
<br> <br> 
Regardless of the fact, Kylon attempts and succeeds to enlist into their ranks,
starting off as a simple soldier doing field missions and labouring training. however
Kylon was the kind of man who put in his all at all times, and he quickly outshined
his co-workers. and as such the ligher ups began to give him raises and promotions.
Now he was a ██████ stationed at Outpost-██ just beyond the City of ████████. His life
felt like it had significantly improved, and he hadn't left anything behind in trade for
this better lifestyle. To him it felt perfect. Too perfect.
<br> <br>
One night, on October ████ 2024, he had woke up due to some unrest that had been a 
result of the training session he had been put through for the day, due to not being 
able to sleep, he decided to walk around the facility. It was then a few minutes into 
his walk that he overheard a conversation between three individuals. One being a 
Facility Director, another being one of the numerous generals, and the third was a 
Girl he had never seen before, Her unique attire made her seem important. Kylon 
couldn't understand all of the fancy terms and corporal jargin that they were talking 
about, but the only comprihensible things to him in his sleep deprived state was talks 
of a stage in a  Project, one that involved the soldiers at the Facility. In an attempt 
to play his presence off, he began to walk away back to his rooms. However after he saw 
a crimson red glow from behind him, his head was struck and he fell down.
<br> <br>
At the start of the new day, he reawoke in his bed. His co-workers were all there with 
him, however there was a distinct lack of Soldiers lower than his own rank. Mid way 
through the day, in the cafeteria, the same general from last night had approached him 
with a deal, and requested to speak to him in private. The general stated that thanks to 
the anonymous person who had knocked him out during the night, they were aware of his 
easedropping in on their confidential talk. In an interesting turn of events however, 
The General offered to promote Kylon once more into a member of the notorious STFU unit 
due to the commitment he had (apparently) shown to their cause through his effort, being 
a STFU unit meant he would get access to experimental MERC Augments and a Higher array 
of Weapons and training. Kylon knew that by the way that the general was talking, he was 
being backed into a corner to agree. So, he agreed.
<br> <br>
He was given one day before he would be moved into his new quarters, he spent the rest 
of the day mulling over his decision, and after the recent disappearances of Soldiers, 
he became paranoid. So he makes the smart decision of.. running away.
<br> <br>
They definitely saw him running for the city, but they honestly didn't care enough to
prioritise finding him since he was too far gone from the buildings. Kylon's legs
felt like they were going to break, sure he was a fit guy, but the speed and distance
that he had ran began to make his body collapse. Fortunately, he ran into a passerby
who was shopping around. Calling for their attention, in a state of mind where nobody
could think clearly, he began to spill out everything of what he had just experienced
to get the stress off his chest.
<br> <br>
The stranger listened intently, not caring if it made sense to her or not. After Kylon
had finished his aimless rambling, the stranger handed him a business card for an Agency,
stating that this is where he should go if he wishes to make a change (whatever that meant).
He had  hesitancy considering the events he just went through, and didn't call for a few
months, but due to the possibility of what he heard to all be true, he picked up his phone
and dialed to join Project Liberation.

<br>
<u> <b>PROS AND CONS:</b> </u> <br>
<+> Due to being a past member of The Insurgency, he knows a good deal about The City and
the enemies, despite never directly going to The Insurgency City before.
<br>
<+> He's quite durable, and due to his training, he know how to ignore some heavy injuries.
While he isn't perfect at ignoring them, he tries his best.
<br>
<-> The paranoia and the experience that he went through when he found out about could truly
be going on behind the scenes has left an affect on him, to the point he now actively avoids
talking about his past job, and if confronted, it weight on him at a level where he becomes
weaker, both mentally and physically.

<i> Supreme Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The Soldat Commander, Dark, is an incredibly cocky and arrogant, yet extremely dangerous member of The Insurgency. He has been
apart of the group since his younger years, and despite knowing the flaws and idiocy that is within the group, he serves loyally as
his own mind has grown twisted and warped to suit his own survival in the chaotic battlegrounds that he himself loves to create.
<br> <br> 
To pair with this, as if it wasn't enough, Dark is a pyromaniac, and loves to watch the world burn. His partner, XeeIee, actively
encourages these vile acts for his own entertainment, and his father, also one of the notorious Employers, so obviously he has been
pushed into this horrific mindset not for his own need to survive, but because of the peer pressure from a 'friend' and family.
<br> <br>
Before his rise into the ranks as the Soldat Commander, Dark was a special agent working on the Potential Life anomaly, a god named
Insinitie, and was tasked with infiltrating one of the groups that went against the god, The Saving Grace, and using the gathered info
to relay it to higher ups.
<br> <br>
This plan never went according to plan as Insinitie captured everyone, and broke Dark's Radio, resulting in a younger XeeIee who still
knew who his own identity was to come in and assist Dark. Both were shortly dubbed KIA and MIA in order, and thus Calidus Sent the
MERC Retrieval Team, Consisting of Golden Scout, Guest_362, and Light, to find and revive the bodies. And to dispatch Maks for his Life
Syringe dare he ever finished making it.
<br> <br>
Dark was trapped in Insinitie's Void, half dead, half alive, and separated from Guest_360 and Slipstream Gold, two others who found themselves
within the Void. We do not know what happened during his stay within this location, but we suspect that the extended exposure affected his
mental state for the worst. He stayed in there until Guest_362 was able to reverse engineer a machine to open a portal to the void and retrieve
Dark, by then XeeIee was already alive, and they also convinced a previously dead Guest_360 to join the team.
<br> <br>
From there Calidus used these unqiue survivors and made what he dubbed as "The Broken Specialists." A team that comprised of Guest, XeeIee, and
Dark. While the squad lasted, the mental states of Dark and XeeIee deteriorated, while Guest stayed as the somewhat sane one, and thus called his
forced leave from the task force, Leaving Dark and XeeIee as a due, from there, Calidus has already reassigned the three their own new jobs within
The Insurgency City, which is where we find them today.
<br> <br>
Despite this, it does not change the sheer danger that these agents can and will pose to your team if you leave them unchecked, and god knows what
happens if you give them a losing streak.
<br> <br>
Because I can tell you now, Dark does not cope with failure well.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Dark loves melee, like, really loves melee. Expect him to rush towards you a lot in order to commit to that method of attack. It might seem counter
intuitive, but if you're in melee range of Dark, DO NOT USE A GUN! He WILL dissarm you and toss your weapons onto the floor. Melee is the only way
to counter him if he gets up close and personal, and most cases will lead to you clashing with him.
<br> <br>
* Be careful with your damage output! Don't kill Dark too fast as dropping his health in absurd amount is a quickfire way to
cause him to ENRAGE. If he enrages, one of your teammates are guaranteed to lose a corpus. Wittle his health down slowly, play the long game with him.
And when the moment strikes, Blast him with all you got!
<br> <br>
* Dark is a dodger, but he's also tanky and loves to counter attack. If you see him standing still, ready to take an attack, there is a very high chance
that it's a settup. Not all the time, but just be mindful of what he's doing at all times.

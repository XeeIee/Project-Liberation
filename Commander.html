<i> Greater Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Commanders are the forefront of tactics for The Insurgency army.
They act as the centre comms relayer for squads, using their radios,
they can call in assistance if given the chance. They wear some of
the most protective standard military gear out of the majority of the
fodder, and are just as skilled as any other non-fodder member of The
Insurgency.
<br> <br> 
The Insurgencies chain of command is a weird one, because it doesn't
function in traditional senses, but more of a VIP system, whoever's more
important will get the more lesiures. For example, most fodder are treated
the same whereas Commanders are valued to keep soldiers on track and organised.
This also means one of the same kind of unit could be more important than
another. Obviously Calidus and The Employers are at the top of the chain,
but from there it gets weird.
<br> <br>
Technically Scientists and Elite members like Royal Guards, XeeIee, and Dark
get next priority, But there's so little scientists that aren't in MERC That
it's basically only elite members. Then there's the fodder. The system is way
more intricate than this, however it's not like they'll be using artillary
or bombing runs on their own city.. Right?
<br> <br>
Commanders, while still playing a vital role for The Insurgency, don't have a lot
going for them. They communicate info between squads and that's it.
<br> <br>
..I think.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Commanders will usually only show up in arena modes, typically closer
to the last batch of enemies. You don't need to worry about them until
later on in an arena as such. Because by then most other higher threats will be
took out, and you can focus on them and ignore the lesser enemies.
<br> <br>
* If Commanders are left to their devices, they can call in reinforcements
in the form of either Soldats, STF's, or <i> ██████ </i>. ██████ Are pretty
late game enemies however, so don't worry about them yet. Regardless, it is
important that they do not get the chance to call reinforcements under
ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. They can do this as many times as they like and have no
cooldown before they can start again, however their ability does have starter
lag, so it won't be turn after turn.
<br> <br>
* Commanders typically carry hand cannons, pistols, or Revolvers on them. Most
of which carry quite a punch, However all these weapons can only do so much. If
you can outmatch them in fire power, then it isn't much of an issue.

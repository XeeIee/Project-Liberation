<b> <u> The Interloper </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Creator of The Cell - Leader of The Interlopers</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The Interloper is an Omnipresent entity with unlimited scale in
powers and capabilities. The motives of The Interloper are
 not easy to understand by anyone, however what is understood is
that it used its abilities to create The Cell, a HyperVerse that
 houses a wide plethora of timelines, realities, universes, 
 multiverses, and omniverses in scale order. An area in particular
is closed off from the rest of the HyperVerse to contain all of
 the Campaigns that currently exist, will exist or were going to
 exist. This includes in no particular order: The Potential Life, 
The Deformed Land, False World, SOULS, Games Collide, Now Or Never,
Protectors of the Core, Project Liberation, Tales of the Depths, 
Another Roleplay, The Degens, and War of the Witless. All of these
Primary universes surround the Nexus Point, the core that makes up
the field that contains all these universes.
<br> <br> 
Basically Zero information is known about the origins or creation
 of the Interloper, the same applies to how much it can do. Though, 
 since the creation of The Cell the Interloper has used its powers
 to enforce and protect universes via direct intervention from
 outside anomalies that jeopardise the course of a universes timeline.
 It used to directly and physically intervene, but now instead of that it works 
behind the scenes to ensure balance, as too much physical 
interaction will break a universe. Instead of this, The 
Interloper has a select few individuals, Also with the title of 
Interlopers, to do the work across The Cell for it. these people are
 also referred to as Interlopers, and are in the billions, which
 isn't many in the scale of Infinity. And only the most trusted of
Interlopers are allowed within the range of the Nexus Point.
Current Known Interlopers: Xeelee, Assistant, Kel_SP(Terminated)
<br> (If you would like to enlist a character to also hold the status
of Interloper, DM me)
<br> <br>
These Interlopers have a portion of Interlopers abilities,
allowing them to Shapeshift, manifest, modify, and warp, amongst
other things, this is all possible with a secondary creation known
 as the Console, a coding console that allows users to manipulate
 reality with commands and scripts as if the world was all lines
 of code.
<br> <br>
The Interloper initially stumbled across The Potential Life, an
idea and concept created by one Slipstream Gold. From this, it
 liked the idea and wanted to try and experiment with a creation
 of their own. The result was a Branch off of the potential life,
 Known by you as Project Liberation. But something went wrong along the creation, 
 more specifically, Something broke through the field that wasn't supposed to,
 this entity that broke through is from a race known outside of The Cell as
The Shattered. Their name? Calidus. It didn't matter how they got in, their 
 presence was not to be ignored, it would leave Project Liberation willingly,
 and could destroy it and the other Campaigns. And so, it started it's story early, 
 to lead the events of Project Liberation, the Liberation now
  being to keep the grasp of this world off of Calidus.

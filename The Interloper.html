<b> <u> The Interloper </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Leader of ████████████████████</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The Interloper is an Omnipotent, Omniscient, Omnipresent, and
otherworldly entity, with no goals or motives, yet finds ways to 
keep itself occupied by using it's unlimited power to ██████████
████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
████████████████████
<br> <br> 
Very little is known about where it exactly came from, the range 
of it's powers or anything about it at all, all that we know is 
that it's an aware entity, who works to stop anomalies that 
appear in universes via direct intervention. It used to directly 
and physically intervene, but now instead of that it works 
behind the scenes to ensure balance, as too much physical 
interaction will break a universe. Instead of this, The 
Interloper has a select few individuals, Also with the title of 
Interlopers, to do the work across not just the realities of a 
Universe, not just a Universe, not just the Multiverse, but 
also across the Omniverse.
<br> <br>
These Interlopers have a portion of Interlopers abilities,
allowing them to Shapeshift, manifest, modify, and warp, amongst
other things. You know some of these Interlopers to be people
like The Assistant, or a version of Xeelee himself(To clarify, 
the one that interacts with Assistant and Interloper, not The 
Owner, same person, different contexts.) However, there are
definitely others, ones that you haven't met, and ones that
hide amongst you, another example? The Informed, an Interloper
technically in training by Interloper himself.
<br> <br>
Interloper itself is technically not an entity, it's a concept
manifested from old ideas of a past world, the guaridan of this
old world, dubbed The Black Holes Custodian, gave up on this
old world, and started anew. From here they used The Cell's new
capabilities to latch onto a concept, a world known by others
, and manifest from Fantasy, to Reality. The product of this was
The Interloper, created as an overwatch of sorts to The Guardian.
After the disappearance of The Guardian, The Interloper was left
aimless, and used it's powers to create a universe.
<br> <br>
The result was a Branch off of the potential life, from there, it
█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
█████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
████████████████████████████████████████ in order to try and
morph the world into one that was recognisable, but unique.
<br> <br>
Something went wrong along the creation, as the Old World began to
seep through, more specifically, the Black Hole, which was a 
gigantic core in the centre of the Old World, it inhabited entities
known as █████████████, One of them were able to break through,
causing the beginning of the chain of events of Project Liberation.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* If you were to try and fight this entity, it would be ultimately
pointless, it can't be damaged, and outsmarting it is incredibly
tricky, as again, it's omniscient. However the best way to survive
is by allowing it to do what it wants, this is a being that likes
 utmost control over a situation. It sounds cowardly, but submission
 is the only thing that increases your chances of survival.
<br> <br>
* If you <i>do</i> try to fight The Interloper, be prepared for many of
 the games mechanics to be used against you, this is the one who made
 the console, it intends to take full advantage of it's capabilities.
 For example, summoning echos of characters to increase it's numbers
 and make the fight harder, the best thing to do is to dispatch them
 before they over run your squad.
<br> <br>
* Don't expect help from NPC's, Interloper will usually wipe all traces
 of himself when interacting with players within the world of Project
Liberation.

<i> Greater Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Engineers are highly intelligent members of The Insurgency, most of their
jobs consist of doing maintanence on the huge infrastructure of The 
Insurgency City, as well as building and expanding. However their job also
consists of piloting vehicles and manning massive weapons, think a big turret
for example.
<br> <br> 
Engineers have back packs that act both as a signal communicator and as a storage
unit as a means of storing their tools and weapons, unlike guards, Engineers actually
keep weapons on them unlike most guards, it's not that they can be trusted it's that
they're experienced enough to use them.
<br> <br>
A common theme with The Insurgency is anonymous nature, every member of The Insurgency
are required to keep their faces covered to conceal thieir identity, it also acts as a
layer of protection against weapons.  Engineers however intend to wear their safety equipment
more than their required uniform. The Insurgency sorted this by making the required face covering
their safety equipment.
<br> <br>
Most engineers often die brutally in freak accidents, this is partly because The Insurgency work
on helping MERC with their projects, it's also because these projects are highly dangerous.
<br> <br>
Some projects were so dangerous that The Insurgency had to seal them within the <i>mining
sector</i>, so Engineers are around the sector on the regular, along with guards, to keep
the things that roam around in while also fixing the damages made.
<br> <br>
Engineers often aren't good people either, they know what they're doing and they enjoy doing it.
However they aren't the most deranged personnel from within the ranks of The Insurgency.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* engineers are often found labouring away on their tasks, this makes them really easy to sneak
around, takedown, and overall their presence makes stealth easier.
<br> <br>
* The best time to attack an engineer is when they're reloading, as they will most likely not
take any cover.

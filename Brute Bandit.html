<b> <u> Brute Bandit </b> </u> <br>

<i> Greater Junkie</i>

<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Brute Bandits are just big buff versions of normal Bandits, falling into a 
brawn stereotype of being really stupid while also being really strong.
<br> <br> 
They wear more durable junk compared to normal Bandits, mainly because it's
practical, but he have quoted some saying "because it looks rad asf."
<br> <br>
The <i>Bandit Queen</i> Likes to take the Brutes and make them do her dirty
work, normally mundane tasks like getting food or stuff like that, however she
likes to casually dispose of Bandits and otherwise alike by kicking them down a
random big pit she found. Mainly because she can. if you heard it from her own people
they'd call her a nut job, but that's only because half of the bandits are nutjobs themselves
<br> <br>
Most bandits lack proper grammar aswell, most notable example being "hay" in place
of "hey", they aren't the smartest, which is also why they don't have a big flashy
career like most people in the UK in this world.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* It's in the name, but Brutes classify as Brute enemies, if you attack them enough times, they
should be anglered and throw a pissy attack fit, from there it's easy to dispose of them with a 
quick takedown.
<br> <br>
* All brutes are unarmed, so they're really easy to combat, just don't get caught in their grabs.
<br> <br>
* Speaking of grabs, be careful of any enemy that can grab you when on higher difficulties like tough.
If you dont have the health to tank the attack, then that could be an easy corpus lost, some enemies
might even one shot your corpus in a grab despite you being full health.

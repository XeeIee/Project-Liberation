<i> Supreme MERC</i>

<br>
<b>DATA:</b>

<br> <br> 
Before collaborating with <i>The Insurgency</i>, The MERCS, better known currently as the Matter 
and Energy Reclamation Corporation, were Notorious for their mechanics, being able to build very
complex and in depth machinery, weapons, armour, and anything inbetween. They would supply these
items to Factions across the United States, and upon moving to the UK to expand their influence,
The Insurgency took hold and how keeps the UK HQ of MERC Within' their walls of the took over
city.
<br> <br>
Nobody knows how this was pulled off, for many it just seemed to happen over night, however the
reason lies within Golden Scout, the closest thing the MERCS have to a leader, and one that
supposedly killed the MERC's old leader, and also an agent that worked with The Insurgency to
betray the MERC's and put them under the work of The Insurgency.
<br> <br>
The MERC's now specialise in twisted experiments, however remnents of their old creations still
exist, as well as new ones, in fact, most if not all of the machines that you encounter belong
to the MERCS, minus 1 or 2 exceptions. 
<br> <br>
 Despite Golden Scouts snarky bravado, once challenged, he often breaks his tough persona in
change for a more cowardice like one. He is a hard to understand individual, and even his
rival, Commander Alice, sees him as an absolute nutjob, yet somehow he is the most convincing
lier many have seen, being able to even bullshit his way through the leader of The Insurgency,
not only does a feat like that take massive guts to accomplish, but it also requires massive wit
and a capability to withstand the leader's twisted nature.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Golden Scout fights dirty, however he is also cowardly, most odds he will try to run away 
from you once the game's not in his favour, so try to keep him around if you don't want him
running off like the coward he is.
<br> <br>
* Golden Scout is a really tough opponent, and is your first heavy obstacle in your way of 
completing Project Liberation, it would be wise to not under estimate, regardless of your
situation, he loves surprises.
<br> <br>
* Golden Scout has a plethora of weapons and will try to Use his full arsenal against you.
One of his weapons is a <i>Flashbang</i>, Which if thrown will stun the majority of your.
The best way to counter act this deadly move is by throwing the Flashbang back, which will
in turn stun him instead, however don't expect him to be out for long, nor should you expect
him to go into a dizzy state.

<b> <u> Guard </b> </u> <br>

<i> Lesser Insurgent</i>

<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Guards are the most humane of The Insurgencies staff, and also the most naive. They are very
much blind to the twisted background that the corrupt militia has on it's hands, and as such,
follow their rule and cause very blindly.
<br> <br> 
Most guards are random Robloxians took from the street, or blackmailed, into working. this has
been proven to be effective so far, though this does mean that their experience with actual 
military practices are near to non existent. They do, however, have enough capability to use
melee's effectively via a slow virtual training program.
<br> <br>
This program, while infact helping with the experience of the guards, were unknowingly brain
washing them into obedient slaves, their morality and mind would stay the same, but their
resolve to go through with The Insurgencies goals were absolute.
<br> <br>
Despite the poor unescapable fate that these souls find themselves condemned to, they are still
normal human beings that just do as told. This, however, can't be said for more devoted 
members of The Insurgencys cause.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Guards are fairly easy to deal with, boasting low hp, low defense, low dodge rate, and are
basically fodder on the battle field. One heavy hit from a melee or a shot from a higher
caliber gun will almost always dispatch them.
<br> <br>
* The one major danger of Guards are their awareness on the battlefield, despite being weak,
they are relatively smart, and will often avoid or counter most advanced attacks, in order 
to counter this, all you have to do it attack them with simple weapons or your bear hands.

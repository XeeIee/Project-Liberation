<b> <u> XeeIee </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Supreme Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
XeeIee has many titles, some, but not all, being The Mercenary, The STFU Commander, 
and The Magna Mori. Very little is known about his past, however, a lot is known 
about his present, that he's a Violent, sociopathic freak and a force of nature that 
even the employers fear. He's died twice now and shows no signs of staying dead 
permanently. He truly is a detached freak.
<br> <br> 
He never used to go by XeeIee, he used to be a normal military soldier named.. well..
 you could probably guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. Regardless, he was a result of the Potential Life 
anomaly's super soldier program, kidnapped and forced through trials along with several
other unwilling test subjects. Their memories stay intact, maybe even replaced, but how
they got in that situation is unknown. Eventually, XeeIee was able to run off, his mind
shattered, he was no longer a sane man, he was vulnerable, and then came The Angel.
<br> <br>
The Angel gave XeeIee promises of freedom, of clarity, in exchange for residing in his
mind, his conscious, his being, the most notible promise being that he would never die.
 XeeIee, in his weakened mind, accepted. Unfortunately, what happened after in this deal
is unknown to us, but XeeIee snapped that same day, and became the way he is.
<br> <br>
At the earlier stages, XeeIee could care, as he chose to reveal his hiding spot instead of
one of his teammates died. But then, his mental state got worse, and as he died more and more,
he lost himself, more and more. He would always come back, wounds healing, armour mending, and
goggles blaring with anger, but he would forever remain a husk of himself.
<br> <br>
It's sad, when you think about it, a ruined life by outside factors, doesn't that sound
familiar?
<br> <br>
...Aaaah probably not, you wouldn't know such, right, Commander?

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* XeeIee is impossible to properly enrage. Why you may ask?? Because he's permanently enraged
at all times! His anger is a gauge for his damage output and his resistance to attacks, while
he may take more damage, his anger might cause him to ignore things that would otherwise hinder
the average human.
<br> <br>
* XeeIee's Katana, Kamigoroshi, is a custom made powerful weapon crafted by Employer-05, the creation
was also assisted by Lord Calidus. It allows him to transfer his anger into energy, and then push that
 energy into the katana, this can do many things, just make sure that he's holding the katana with his
 right hand. If he's holding it with his left, start panicking.
<br> <br>
* XeeIee is hard to reason with, and that isn't an exaggeration, he's too stubborn for his own good.
He would only keep you alive if he saw it to benefit himself. He's always planning something, be vigilant.
<br> <br>
* Many of XeeIee's predetermined moves require Dark to be with him in order to pull them off, they're both
equally at their most dangerous when as a duo, try and find ways to separate the two of them.

<i> Lesser Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
In the Insurgency, women and men are given stark differences in terms
of roles. It isn't an act of sexism, but more of a way to expand on the
physical positives of both genders, for a good example, men are often given
the more physical jobs while women get the supporting roles. This isn't the
case <i> all </i> the time, as there exists a role for women that allow them
to be on the front lines more often, however this isn't what I'm here to
talk about.
<br> <br> 
Medics are one of the many roles that are Female exclusive,mainly because
they're smaller targets but also because Medics are a purely supporting role.
Medics tend to be in the grey in terms of morality, their role requires them
to know some of the Insurgency's secrets, however, they don't like what they're
doing. Medics are often paid well in The Insurgency, and due to their nefarious
ways of locking members within the faction, they don't tend to have the option
to leave. And don't get me started on the punishments given to those that try 
to rebel..
<br> <br>
Medics use a modified Accelerator, an item that belongs to MERC, mainly because
MERC is a split division of Team Tower Defence, and thus they would naturally
have some of this tech. this accelerator has two modes, Healing, and shielding.
Healing spews out a concentrated beam that speeds up the mitosis within the cells,
allowing them to heal from injuries faster, if at all. Shielding instead hardens
and toughens the skin, muscles, and bonesin order to withstand almost all damage
without injury, however just incase that doesn't work, the accelerator also projects
a shield in order to act as a primary line of defense, while the physical attributes
are more of a secondary.
<br> <br>
It is actually possible for Medics to climb up the ranks and become soldiers, however
many will often reject the opportunity, as many, if not all of them, either value
their life more than the others, or don't actually believe in the causes that The
Insurgency fights for. THose that do take the opportunity are often marked with an arm
band, these ones are Lead Medics, and they often do belive in the insurgency's cause, being
as deranged as the average Soldat. In a heart beat, most lower medics will betray The 
Insurgency, however, that's where a MERC invention comes into play.
<br> <br>
There is a chip implanted into every full time member of The Insurgency, should they
get out of control, then Employer-04 will remotely detonate it using his copy of the
Employer console. it's grim, however, this is actually one of the more tamer punishments
for treason within the insurgency.
<br> <br>
Medics just want to survive, they have no ill intent and would never willingly hurt you.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The back for the medical accelerator holds very unstable energy, if it's shot with a gun
of high enough caliber, then it will explode, killing the medic and often injuring those
nearby.
<br> <br>
* Medics are very reasonable, if Medics are alone with no enemy to heal, they become Reasonable.
This does exclude Lead Medics, however they might try to act coy to trick you. pay attention to
if they're wearing an arm band or not.
<br> <br>
* Medics can use the Medical Accelerator on eachother, however they can't directly connect it
to each other, make sense, no? Well, a Medic can use the gun on a medic, and this can stack.
HOWEVER, if all medics are being healed, then it completes a circuit, which then causes the
back tanks to overload and blow up. Case in point, there will always be one vulnerable Medic.

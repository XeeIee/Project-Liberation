<i> Supreme MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Guest_362, like Guest_360, is a supreme member of the faction he supports. MERC
Don't actually have many people that are specifically committed to MERC, many of
them are hired mercenaries or people with temporary contracts, Guest_362 is one
of those Mercenaries, Joint with Molten and GS as a trio in the earlier days, but
after Molten became Light, and GS became the leader of MERC, 362 decided to extend an
extra helping hand by extending his contract.
<br> <br> 
Guest_362 currently sits as the Left Hand Man of MERC, one of the best engineers
the world has seen, while also being a 'certified' Medic due to his own infamous
item, the Regen Coil. This is actually a modified version that acts as a far less
dangerous Medical Accelerator.
<br> <br>
Guest_362 and 360 are both friends, however the reasons why are a bit more vauge, as 
362 reminds 360 of another guest, 361, however it's unclear why. It's also unclear why 
there are a string of people all named Guest with the numbers 360 and beyond. Every 
guest, 360, 361, 362, 363, 364, and 365 are rumoured to actually be all parts of one 
person, split into separate similar bodies and personalities, that's the conclusion 
The Insurgency came up with anyways, remains to actually be seen. There are also also
rumours of a more mysterious and evil 359, but nobody, not even the other guests, can
confirm his existance.
<br> <br>
So far the only ones that are apart of The Insurgency and MERC alike are 360 and 362, 
there are rumours of another guest to somehow be involved, but nobody has ever gotten 
to confirm this.
<br> <br>
The Line of Guests is a deep mystery, one that only the Guests themselves fully 
understand.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Almost very Guest can be reasoned with, they aren't morally bad people and are usually
actually pretty chill, once their health is low enough, they become reasonable, which
will allow you to try and diplomatically converse with them, assuming no other enemies
are nearby.
<br> <br>
* Like Engineers, Guest_362 will often pilot machinery in his fights to garner the upper
hand, whether they be robots, mechs or vehicles, they will still be used, best that
you look for weak spots within the machines (If you were able to recover phineus before
hand, then this is a cakewalk.)
<br> <br>
* Guest_362's regen coil isn't as impactful as you think, only healing by small margins
every turn, but if you really want to stop him from doing that, then any stun esc effects
can temporarily stop the healing.

<b> <u> STFU </b> </u> <br>
</font> <font size=12>
<i> Greater Insurgent</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The STFU on the surface seem like heartless and devoted soldiers of The Insurgency,
used as all-rounders that can carry out any task, hold any weapons, and take any
missions. They are ruthless and spiteful, the worst of the worst soldiers, irredeemable
and unrecognisable of their former identities. Their trademark is the balaclava mask
that they wear, as they often have light identifiable seeps of blood pouring through
the fabric.
<br> <br> 
STFU Don't actively roam the city like other units, they need to be specifically called
into action, typically by those with clearance to do so, but they can also be called if
you allow one of the following; A Unit to escape, A Commander to call them in, An alarm
is pulled, or if XeeIee is around, seeing that he's the STFU Commander.
<br> <br>
<b> ERR, REDACTION FAIL </b> <br>
However, as you may have already figured out by now, The STFU are more than just soldiers,
they are select victims of The Insurgency's experiments and torture, turned into soldiers
to serve, die, and blow up.This isn't all of them, as some are actual Robloxians, but a
good portion are corpses kept alive to serve and die. the only way you can help them now
is by putting them out o their misery. It's depressing, but if they're an STFU, then they're
beyond saving, unless you really want to invest a ton of time and effort into it, such a thing
is more suitable for cleanup crew to invest in, you have a job to do, remember?
<br> <br>
There are a lot of races that have been subject to this torture, some of the races being,
but not limited to, Razor Clones, Nusians, Dominians, Deerlings, Agents of rivalling
factions like UNIT and The Agency, and even Autonomous machines like the Combat Dummies.
Yup, there's a lot, and a lot of people that can easily be offended by this.
<br> <br>
The torture process when it goes successfully is painful and lengthy, at the end of a
successful process the victim will usually be more numb to pain, even to the point
that pain makes them laugh, their bodies will no longer feel like their own, thanks
to The Parasites They feel like they will have no control over their own body, yet
they are very clearly awake, aware, and while the parasite doesn't feel the pain, they
do. Don't think getting the parasite out will help either, it will just paralyse the victim.
For more information on Parasites and the infection process go to the Parasite page when is
is unlocked.
<br> <br>
It's as I said, irredeemable and unrecognisable of their former identities..

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The STFU Are insanely cocky, which makes them underestimate you in most cases. You can use
that to your advantage.
<br> <br>
* Truth be told, STFU Units have no weaknesses, the best way to deal with them is to just to
out power them in terms of fire power. However be aware of their strengths, they have more
awareness and dodge more often, splash weapons really help with this as they are all around
harder to dodge.
<br> <br>

<br>
<b>Trivia:</b> <br>
* I actually have a lot of designs made for the tortured bodies of some of the listed STFU.
For example, I have a few designs for Nusians and Dominians, a few for the pumpkins, I never
got around to the Deerlings because I kicked luigi out, but they are still (currently as of
14/5/2024) canon, If I wanted to do UNIT I would need to ask Razor for standard unit designs,
knowing how bro is bored half the the time, that is harder said than done.

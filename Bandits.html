<b>DATA:</b>
Bandits are, well, bandits. They are as the name implies. Bandits are part of a 
very unknown gang that had moved to The Insurgency Outskirts in an attempt to try
and break in to make a name for themselves. This is currently not working out for them,
however, as MERC Rangers constantly keep them at bay with well placed shots to the brain.
<br> <br> 
Though in the defence of the Bandits, The Insurgency Outskirts technically count as a
lawless area due to no law enforcement ever wanting to step a foot near Insurgency
Territory, so credit where credit is due, they have that going for them.
<br> <br>
Since Bandits aren't military soldiers, or high trained special operators, you can imagine
that their skills and firepower are minimal. You'd be right, however they have a bunch
of melee's that they have gathered over time which they could use to take you out. However
you have guns, and they don't, a little one sided I think.
<br> <br>
The Insurgency has contemplated numerous times to permanently get rid of Bandits, but have
deemed them useful as they are unironically acting as a line of defence before getting to
their pearly gates. This decision was made specifically by Employer #5, AKA Roman, you can
thank him later for the hard time.
<br> <br>
At the end of the day Bandits are just poor people trying to survive, albeit with illegal
methods. They don't have any lives outside of what they do, nor are they empathetic. However
just a nice reminder that the Bandits are one of the more humane enemies compared to the likes
of MERC, or The Insurgency.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* DON'T WASTE YOUR AMMO! Bandits are really weak and using bullets on them are just not worth
it. Instead, use any melee's that you have to preserve ammo, or if you really have to, use
your gun as the melee with a swift pistol whip or rifle bash, whatever you got on you.
<br> <br>
* Bandits often come in hoards, if push comes to shove, a good splash weapon will clear them
in seconds.

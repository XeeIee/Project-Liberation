<font size="6"> <br>Your kidnappers now make themselves known as Commander Alice
and Lieutenant Mike, they intend to brief you in on the situation at hand so that
you are up to speed with your objective. Lucky for you, Dee will also train you behind 
the scenes before your big venture into the unknown. With a moderately suspicious truck
the plan is to drive full force into enemy lines, disregarding the <i>bandits</i> that live
just on the outskirts of the Insurgency City, what could go wrong?</font> <br> <br>

<font size="6"> <br>After making it into The Insurgency City, things begin to get more dangerous as 
your actions have already been made aware to Lord Calidus. However, in order to sabotage their 
operations and get into the dangerous and dark Mining sector, you must split into two
temporary groups, group one will be with Alice, and the other will be with Mike. Be careful however,
as the outer rim of the city is where MERC keeps their main operations, and it's also home to some
of the most dangerous soldiers around.</font> <br> <br>

<CENTER> Tip of the chapter: </CENTER>
<br>
Don't be afraid to play aggressive! The city knows you're here, most chances of stealth have been compromised.
so if you really need to make a ruckus don't hesitate, the faster you can cut through the fodder forces the faster
you can progress through the story!.

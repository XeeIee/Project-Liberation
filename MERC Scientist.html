<b> <u> MERC Scientist </b> </u> <br>

<i> Supreme MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
The MERC Scientist is an extremely crafty and dangerous individual who should never
be underestimated in witts and physical capabilities. His real name is not known to 
anyone, however he has took the name W█████ based on his past codename as part 
of Task Force T.D, that being ███ ███████. He is responsible for the existence of
several weapons, experiments, Augments, plans and strategies that The Insurgency
and MERC alike have exploited to better their current goal of The Bullseye Project,
and their ultimate goal of █████████ █████ ██████████ and ███████████ ██████.
<br> <br>
W█████ has been a massive driving factor across both TRCC (The Razor Clone Conflict)
and project code Team Extraction, which consisted of gathering several Non Robloxian
Races, By definitian and technical terms, and testing them for unique and otherworldly
properties. From there it would be down to finding ways to use these properties to benefit
The Insurgency and its goals.
<br> <br> 
MERC itself stands for the Matter and Energy Reclamation Corperation, tapping into unknown
properties has been it's primary specialty since the beginning, and for The Insurgency,
it was too much of a time saver to not ask for mutual exchange. While The MERC Scientist
was not the one to carry out the task of merging MERC and The Insurgency together, he did
not care for the morals or the ethically questionable practices that he or others were
assigned to partake in for The Insurgencies gain.
<br> <br>
On regards to Riker, he was actually the one who wanted to turn him into Rix0r. Not for
any nefarious reason to be perfectly honest with you, just because "He wanted to see
what would happen". Actually that's the main motive for W█████'s actions, underlying
curiosity on tapping into the Supernatural. Which is also why he called to the mass
extermination of the Razor Clones. 
<br> <br>
Make no mistake either, The MERC Scientist is also incredibly crafty in engineering,
Mixing his knowledge of Science abnd Engineering he has been able to make projects
of all sorts, like Repurposing The Accelerator into a medical gun for the insurgencies
medics, or making augments like the Sawblade Attachment, or mutilating another race
to stuff them with artificial insides as per The Insurgencies request. You know.
<br>
Normal things.
<br> <br>
One thing is for sure though, do not underestimate this mad scientist. You may have
faced insanity before, but danger lurks when Insanity can be hidden.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The MERC Scientist is not a hands on fighter, he does not like to move, he does
not like to put in effort, but that does not mean he won't. Be careful of his
melee capabilities, he packs a punch and can easily <i> Dizzy </i> your team if
you're not careful enough. Just make sure to keep out of his distance when it's his
turn and you should be fine.
<br> <br>
* The MERC Scientist will rarely ever show up in a room he doesn't want you to be in with
him. Keep an eye out for mechanical creations like robots, mechs, security, experiments,
or even other bosses. Don't be worried if you fail to do this though, because most of
the above have counters or are weak to certain attack types or being attacked in certain
areas. You just need to know where to look. In a rare case, you could try to link a
<i> Technician's Tablet </i> to the machine that's causing you trouble and hack it off,
just be careful you don't fail the QTE.
<br> <br>
* The MERC Scientist is one who can, will, and has learned from your mistakes. He knows
all about you and your tricks, and he has continencies to out strategise your strategies.
My advice to you is to treat attacking him likea game of chess, every move develops your
plans, and allows for future attacks, counters to other moves of his, or for set ups to
future plans.

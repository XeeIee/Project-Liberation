<b>DATA:</b>
Riker Soarum, Brother to Razor Soarum, was a member of the second batch
of The Saving Grace. Excellent with a bow and arrow, and an amazing detective,
He was one of the forefront Supports for his team, able to draw to
conclusion with an incredibly fast and accurate wit, and draw a shot
as fast as those conclusions came. A deadly archer, to be feared by many
who crossed him.
<br> <br> 
But of course, due to the TPL Incident, which he was ultimately apart of,
The Soarum Family mainly fell apart. Razor is MIA, his cowardice and bearing
of the Impact Gauntlet making him a forever target for The Insurgency. And Of course
Riker being executed as part of a "no witnesses" rule when trying to execute
Maks Maladroit. The Insurgency had an initial hypothesis that The Razor Clones
all only came in gradients of blue and green, so when the MERC Scientist had heard
of a Black Pumpkin dispatched by their mercenary squad, he knew he had struck
some form of gold.
<br> <br>
Riker's body was first experimented on with a computer augment that basically
scooped out a part of his head to fit a small computer like machine. This was
enough to stimulate the body into a state of respiration. He was then dragged 
to the mining sector, put through all sorts of processes, but was especially 
steered clear of the parasites, as they were still trying to figure out how to 
maximise their results working on it. The MERC Scientist was able to secure a 
red gauntlet from Calidus' collection, for hefty prices of course. Most of his 
innards were scooped out, replaced with metal internals and artificial augments. 
He felt the whole process. And for some reason, they decided to alienate his
name, changing him from Riker, to RiX0r.
<br> <br>
Behind the subservience caused by a lack of control over his actions, RiX0r can
still express his true self in the form of NotePad files that he writes using
the computer augment he was given at the start of his transformation. Though
overtime these files slowly became more and more incomprehensible as he lost
himself more and more to agony, lack of control, and time.
<br> <br>
And in most cases, Razor would never know what happened to him. It's sickening
how we may never know what happens to a loved one, especially when we're not
looking.

<b> [REDACTED - UNLOCK IN NEXT ENCOUNTER] </b>

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Red Gauntlet is the weakest known gauntlet, only having a Harpoon like grapple
system with an incredibly strong pull and exceptionally strong rope. Each Gauntlet
has the capabilities to keep a host alive through exceptional means, requiring
severe damage to the head or the torso in order to dispatch them. or at the very
least severing the arm. Where this would normally kill a Gauntlet host, It won't work
on RiX0r due to his vast augments making the body move without a life system needed.
Don't think this will be an easy task regardless.
<br> <br>
* The SpearHead has been primarily used as a mobility tool by RiX0r, moving him
great distances away from trouble. However, don't get caught by the Head yourself,
as it is incredibly hard to pry it out of yourself without losing good amounts
of health. The best way is to pry the wound open and the head out with a sharp object, 
and knock the harpoon back to RiX0r. The increased speed of which the harpoon will
fling towards him should tear his decaying body, stunning him for a turn. 
<br> <br>
* RiX0r's behavior is very predictable. He likes to ambush, so keep an eye out around corners
or through doors if you suspect he's nearby. In combat, he works on a simple "Offence, Defence"
System. Backing up and keeping distance while protecting himself if you play aggressively, and
Pushing and giving you little breathing room if you play cautiously. It's best to balance when
to go offensive or defensive, but it's incredibly important to slow him down. Depending on the
mode depends on whether he is more likely to hit and dodge attacks. Offensive = more hits, 
Defensive = more dodges.

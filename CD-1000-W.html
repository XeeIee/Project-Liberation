<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
Before The Agency was established, it used to be a company that specialised in robots
with simulated ai in orer to support other military factions, in order to do this they
Had created many products, but their most successful series being the Combat Dummy.
<br> <br>
The Combat Dummy was a generalised series that allowed for the robot to be specialised
into several modes, whether this be for the frontlines, strategy, or even training other
humans. This was a very successful series, and several of these were created for numerous
other military factions.
<br> <br>
They had continued to serve their use, before the company transitioned into The Agency after
A change of plans from the higher ups, many of the CD series have been relocated to the hq and
Distributed to only Agency bases for enhanced training, however some were not recovered. 
<br> <br>
The Warrior is one of the many settings for the CD series and served as the prototype foundation
For many of the other models.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* The Warrior is a patient enemy, they can wait for the right tme to strike, but this comes
with the fault of being undecisive, you can use this to strike them in an easy ambush, they
will always be prone to one
<br> <br>
* The Warrior is a glass cannon, they deal heavy damage, but lack overall defense despite their 
health pool, more heavier attacks can easily dispatch them and leave them criticaly injured.

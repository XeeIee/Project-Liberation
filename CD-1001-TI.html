<b>DATA:</b> 

<br> <br>
CD-1001-TI, referred to as Dee by her peers, is a One of a Kind Model designed to train
the soldiers in The Agency, she is the most advanced of the CD series, and also the most
developed, as she sports her own personality, the TTS Addon, and experimental features such
as being able to repair severe damage via methods not revealed to the public, or even higher
Ranked Commanders like Alice. So they all boil it down to magic, which isn't much of a stretch 
in this world.
<br> <br>
Dee has a variety of knowledge on fighting, it's not a stretch that she holds all knowledge
on Combat, such as situational awareness, how to use weapons and the terminology on each one,
Unarmed, Melee, Ranged combat, And everything else one can think of. She is given the role of
training short groups of soldiers to become elites, and she does the same thing with the PC's
off screen post prelude.
<br> <br>
To add to this, she has an interesting and unique personality which makes her almost feel human,
however she herself is aware of her existance, and is glad to do her things either way. her
Personality is always cheery and never falters, as well as always being upbeat and positive.
The reason why she has this is to give moral support to Soldiers in need, since The
Agency isn't all too lenient to failiure within their ranks, not cruel, just cold.

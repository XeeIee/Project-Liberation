<i> Lesser MERC</i>
<br>
<br>
<b>DATA:</b>
Rangers are one of the member types of MERC that have no engineering role and are strictly militant. 
As in the name, they focus on shooting with range, they don't specialise in much else, but they still
use snipers. 
<br> <br>
One of the main reasons as to why Rangers exist is because of <i> The Wall that 
encompasses The Insurgency City.</i> The wall has to be highly guarded to make sure that nothing with 
the unauthorised access ever gets in or out of the city, while this is their main job, they do other
things. 
<br> <br> 
Some rangers have climbed up the ranks and have become Elite Rangers, Rangers that serve directly under
Golden Scout. When I say Some, I mean one, there is only one Elite Ranger so far because the rest keep
dying to <i>bandit attacks</i>, and have to be constantly replaced, hence they never get the change to
climb the ranks. Sad how the cycle is to go on duty and die to some flying rocks and scrap made weapons
but hey, it could be more painful.
<br> <br>
Rangers have been trained the same like the Scouts and Mercs, however they have more weapon variety, and
are way more flexible. Despite this, they like to stick to Snipers, presumably for the range.
<br> <br>
There isn't much to Rangers, as they haven't made any major changes, or have any deep lore to them, they're
just enemies with snipers, and quite frankly, good enough, it could be worse if they did anything else.

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Snipers will often try to aim for limbs, stay moving so that your limbs don't get disabled.
<br> <br>
* Sometimes Snipers are in unreachable spots, along with cover that they'll just duck under to avoid
oncoming fire, the best way to deal with that is to use an explosive, or anything that causes splash.
<br> <br>
* Rangers use really good snipers instead of standard crumby rifles, it would be advised to get one of
the <i>MERC Rifles</i> to a sharpshooter as early as you can, it can help majorly for the earlier stages
of the campaign.

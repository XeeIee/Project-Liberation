<b>DATA:</b>
Mark I is the very first successful project in regards to The Bullseye Project, however by all
means is still a prototype of future models.
<br> <br> 
Mark I has a really strong exoskeleton that is durable against all kinds of attacks, melee, 
ranged, you name it, it's been covered. However the model was never ready for mass production
and The Insurgency wanted to find a way to test it's current capabilities. And as if 'god' answered
you showed up at the front gate to give Mark I a test drive.
<br> <br>
Mark I's mass production intended to make them multi-purpose tools of warfare and mass destruction, luckily
the one you fought was merely a prototype and was missing it's highly durable outer shell. If we look closer
at The Bullseye Project, this begins to make more sense in terms of prototyping, as the main plan of The
Project was to ███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████

<b>Strategy:</b> <br>
* Mark I follows a very strict battle protocol, you'd better know it as an attack pattern.
This pattern changes after every 3rd of their health disappears, so keep an eye out for
a potential attck style that you can exploit.
<br> <br>
* Mark I classifies as a brute, if you attack them 5 times, they'll be angered and prone to take downs.
when their health is high, it just deals a chunk of damage, if their health is low enough, however, that's
one easy kill.
